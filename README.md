# Belly Button challenge

## Overview
An interactive dashboard for the dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Steps:
A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a bubble chart that displays the same sample and a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
